This is a Ruby on Rails project that was built for Start Up Weekend : EDU Library Edition. 

A live demo of the app can be found at: http://www.stickybookmarks.co

The application itself is a web app that allows users to add books and bookmark scenes within the book. It's a crowdsourced project, so anyone can contribute.

====

The app was built by myself and <a href=https://github.com/programthis/>Kyle Bachan</a>. Development is ongoing with Kyle leading the app.
